<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `depsversion` is to figure out which minimum version to indicate in DESCRIPTION's Import section.

There are 2 main functions here: `get_code()` to get the code for the section, and `build_cache()` to build the information needed for `get_code()`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `depsversion` like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("DanChaltiel/depsversion")
```

## Get started

First, set some options and ask for the code. 

Of note, many packages might be downloaded in `depsversion_target`, so the folder can take several Gb of spaces in some cases.

``` r
library(depsversion)
options(depsversion_cache="path/to/my/cache.rds",
        depsversion_target="path/to/a/dir")
get_code("F:/GITHUB/crosstable/NAMESPACE")
#>Error in `get_code()`:
#>! `cache` is missing information about packages checkmate, cli, dplyr, flextable,
#>  forcats, glue, lifecycle, officer, purrr, rlang, stringr, tibble, and tidyr.
#>  Please run the following code to build it:
#>  depsversion::build_cache(c("checkmate", "cli", "dplyr", "flextable", "forcats", "glue",
#>  "lifecycle", "officer", "purrr", "rlang", "stringr", "tibble", "tidyr"))
```

Of course, your cache is empty at this point, but the error told you to run another function:

``` r
depsversion::build_cache(c("checkmate", "cli", "dplyr", "flextable", "forcats", "glue", "lifecycle", "officer", "purrr", "rlang", "stringr", "tibble", "tidyr"))
#> i Creating new cache file tests/testthat/inst/data_ns.rds.

There you are, you can get the code now!

## WIP

This is a work in progress package, any feedback or collaboration is welcome!

Of note, the `.rds` cache take very little space and it would be nice to have it centralized somewhere but I don't know how...

## Limitations

This package has several, potentially fatal limitations:

> `depsversion` only takes exporting into account

If a function gains a feature without changing name, this will be unnoticed.

You can consider the output of `depsversion` as a minimum though.

> `depsversion` cannot work with `Ã¬mport()` calls in NAMESPACE (only `importFrom`)

It cannot work with direct package reference with `::`.
   
This can be helped using my other package [`autoimport`](https://github.com/DanChaltiel/autoimport) which automatically finds imports by reading your code. Give it a shot!
