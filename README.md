The goal of `depsversion` is to figure out which minimum version to indicate in DESCRIPTION's Import section.

There are 2 main functions here: `get_import_code()` to get the code for the section, and `build_cache()` to build the information needed for `get_import_code()`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `depsversion` like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("DanChaltiel/depsversion")
```



## WIP

This package if heavily experimental, any feedback or collaboration is welcome!

Of note, I'd like to:

 - deal with packages without NAMESPACE
 - add a minimal date so you don't have to download very old archives
 - fix some old bugs (like in "anytime_0.0.1_NAMESPACE")
 - use a DESCRIPTION file in `build_cache()`?


## Get started

Just provide a path to a NAMESPACE file to `get_import_code()`, and there you go.

```r
get_import_code("F:/GITHUB/crosstable/NAMESPACE")
#> Replace the `Imports` section in DESCRIPTION with:
#> Imports:
#>     checkmate (>= 1.9.0),
#>     cli (>= 3.0.0),
#>     dplyr (>= 1.1.0),
#>     flextable (>= 0.5.1),
#>     forcats (>= 1.0.0),
#>     glue (>= 1.3.0),
#>     lifecycle (>= 0.2.0),
#>     methods,
#>     officer (>= 0.4.0),
#>     purrr (>= 0.2.3),
#>     rlang (>= 1.0.0),
#>     stats,
#>     stringr (>= 1.4.0),
#>     tibble (>= 1.1),
#>     tidyr (>= 1.0.0),
#>     utils,
```

OK, let's be honest, that was a bit too easy. 

This function actually relies on a cache file that needs to be built beforehand.

You can download a starting cache using `update_cache_github()`. It is up-to-date for tidyverse packages as of May 2023. 

If you come from the future or if you import non-tidyverse packages, you might need to rebuild the cache using `build_cache("my_package_on_CRAN")`.


First, you need to download the cache file:

```r
update_cache_github()
#> trying URL 'https://github.com/DanChaltiel/depsversion/raw/main/inst/data_ns.rds'
#> Content type 'application/octet-stream' length 363495 bytes (354 KB)
#> downloaded 354 KB
#> 
#> ! Local cache is missing 3955 versions of 211 packages
#> v Local cache has been updated


build_cache("crosstable")
#> -- Init ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#> Found 3955 versions of 211 packages in inst/data_ns.rds.
#> v Cache is up-to-date for crosstable!
```



Don't worry, `get_import_code()` will tell you what code you should run if needed (See section "from scratch" in the end).




## Limitations

This package has several, potentially fatal limitations:

> `depsversion` only takes exporting into account

If a function gains a feature without changing name, this will be unnoticed.

You can consider the output of `depsversion` as a minimum though.

> `depsversion` cannot work with `Ã¬mport()` calls in NAMESPACE (only `importFrom`)

It cannot work with direct package reference with `::`.
   
This can be helped using my other package [`autoimport`](https://github.com/DanChaltiel/autoimport) which automatically finds imports by reading your code. Give it a shot!


## Start from scratch

The "Get started" example is working using pre-built information that were up-to-date on may 2023. Here is how it look like to start from scratch.

First, set some options and ask for the code. 

Of note, many packages might be downloaded in `depsversion_target`, so the folder can take several Gb of spaces in some cases.

``` r
library(depsversion)
options(depsversion_cache="path/to/my/cache.rds",
        depsversion_target="path/to/a/dir")
get_import_code("F:/GITHUB/crosstable/NAMESPACE")
#>Error in `get_import_code()`:
#>! `cache` is missing information about packages checkmate, cli, dplyr, flextable,
#>  forcats, glue, lifecycle, officer, purrr, rlang, stringr, tibble, and tidyr.
#>  Please run the following code to build it:
#>  depsversion::build_cache(c("checkmate", "cli", "dplyr", "flextable", "forcats", "glue",
#>  "lifecycle", "officer", "purrr", "rlang", "stringr", "tibble", "tidyr"))
```

Of course, your cache is empty at this point, but the error told you to run another function:

``` r
depsversion::build_cache(c("checkmate", "cli", "dplyr", "flextable", "forcats", "glue", "lifecycle", "officer", "purrr", "rlang", "stringr", "tibble", "tidyr"))
#> i Creating new cache file tests/testthat/inst/data_ns.rds.
#> 
#> -- Init ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#> Found 0 versions of 0 packages in tests/testthat/inst/data_ns.rds.
#> Warning in miniCRAN::pkgDep(pkg, suggest = FALSE) :
#>   partial argument match of 'suggest' to 'suggests'
#> Updating cache for 77/77 dependencies for checkmate, cli, dplyr, flextable, forcats,
#> glue, lifecycle, officer, purrr, rlang, stringr, tibble, and tidyr.
